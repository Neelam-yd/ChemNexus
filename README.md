Al-Driven Hazardous Chemical Substitution
Platform
1. Overview:
The use of hazardous chemicals in manufacturing and industrial
processes poses significant risks to both human health and the
environment. These chemicals can lead to pollution, health
issues, and safety hazards. An Al-driven platform designed to
suggest safer, eco-friendly alternatives can help mitigate these
risks by providing tailored recommendations based on specific
applications and environmental impact. This platform aims to
enhance sustainability and promote the adoption of safer
chemicals in various industries.
2. Goal:
Develop an Al-powered platform that:
a. Analyzes the hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing or
industrial processes.
b. Suggests safer, eco-friendly alternatives that are suitable for
the specific application and minimize environmental impact.
c. Provides insights into the potential benefits and risks
associated with the suggested substitutes.
3. Deliverables:
⚫ A functional Al platform that provides recommendations for
chemical substitutions based on application requirements
and environmental considerations.
• A database of hazardous chemicals and their eco-friendly
alternatives.
• Documentation detailing the Al algorithms, platform
functionality, and the rationale behind recommendations.
A presentation showcasing the platform's impact on
improving safety, sustainability, and compliance with
environmental regulations.
